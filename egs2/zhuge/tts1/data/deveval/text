LJ049-0008 and detailing police in civilian clothes to be scattered throughout the sizable crowd.
LJ049-0009 When President and Mrs. Kennedy shook hands with members of the public along the fences surrounding the reception area, they were closely guarded by Secret Service agents
LJ049-0010 who responded to the unplanned event with dispatch.
LJ049-0011 As described in chapter two, the President directed that his car stop on two occasions during the motorcade so that he could greet members of the public.
LJ049-0012 At these stops, agents from the Presidential follow-up car stood between the President and the public,
LJ049-0013 and on one occasion Agent Kellerman left the front seat of the President's car to take a similar position.
LJ049-0014 The Commission regards such impromptu stops as presenting an unnecessary danger,
LJ049-0015 but finds that the Secret Service agents did all that could have been done to take protective measures.
LJ049-0016 The Presidential limousine.
LJ049-0017 The limousine used by President Kennedy in Dallas was a convertible with a detachable, rigid plastic "bubble" top
LJ049-0018 which was neither bulletproof nor bullet resistant.
LJ049-0019 The last Presidential vehicle with any protection against small-arms fire left the White House in nineteen fifty-three.
LJ049-0020 It was not then replaced because the state of the art did not permit the development of a bulletproof top of sufficiently light weight
LJ049-0021 to permit its removal on those occasions when the President wished to ride in an open car.
LJ049-0022 The Secret Service believed that it was very doubtful that any President would ride regularly in a vehicle with a fixed top, even though transparent.
LJ049-0023 Since the assassination, the Secret Service, with the assistance of other Federal agencies and of private industry,
LJ049-0024 has developed a vehicle for the better protection of the President.
LJ049-0025 Access to passenger compartment of Presidential car.
LJ049-0026 On occasion the Secret Service has been permitted to have an agent riding in the passenger compartment with the President.
LJ049-0027 Presidents have made it clear, however, that they did not favor this or any other arrangement which interferes with the privacy of the President and his guests.
LJ049-0028 The Secret Service has therefore suggested this practice only on extraordinary occasions.
LJ049-0029 Without attempting to prescribe or recommend specific measures which should be employed for the future protection of Presidents,
LJ049-0030 the Commission does believe that there are aspects of the protective measures employed in the motorcade at Dallas which deserve special comment.
LJ049-0031 The Presidential vehicle in use in Dallas, described in chapter two,
LJ049-0032 had no special design or equipment which would have permitted the Secret Service agent riding in the driver's compartment
LJ049-0033 to move into the passenger section without hindrance or delay. Had the vehicle been so designed it is possible that an agent riding in the front seat
LJ049-0034 could have reached the President in time to protect him from the second and fatal shot to hit the President.
LJ049-0035 However, such access to the President was interfered with both by the metal bar some fifteen inches above the back of the front seat
LJ049-0036 and by the passengers in the jump seats.
LJ049-0037 In contrast, the Vice Presidential vehicle, although not specially designed for that purpose,
LJ049-0038 had no passenger in a jump seat between Agent Youngblood and Vice President Johnson to interfere with Agent Youngblood's ability
LJ049-0039 to take a protective position in the passenger compartment before the third shot was fired.
LJ049-0040 The assassination suggests that it would have been of prime importance
LJ049-0041 in the protection of the President if the Presidential car permitted immediate access to the President by a Secret Service agent at the first sign of danger.
LJ049-0042 At that time the agents on the framing boards of the follow-up car were expected to perform such a function.
LJ049-0043 However, these agents could not reach the President's car when it was traveling at an appreciable rate of speed.
LJ049-0044 Even if the car is traveling more slowly, the delay involved in reaching the President may be crucial.
LJ049-0045 It is clear that at the time of the shots in Dallas, Agent Clinton J. Hill leaped to the President's rescue as quickly as humanly possible.
LJ049-0046 Even so, analysis of the motion picture films taken by amateur photographer Zapruder
LJ049-0047 reveals that Hill first placed his hand on the Presidential car at frame three forty-three, thirty frames
LJ049-0048 and therefore approximately one point six seconds after the President was shot in the head.
LJ049-0049 About three point seven seconds after the President received this wound,
LJ049-0050 Hill had both feet on the car and was climbing aboard to assist President and Mrs. Kennedy.
LJ049-0051 Planning for motorcade contingencies.
LJ049-0052 In response to inquiry by the Commission regarding the instructions to agents in a motorcade
LJ049-0053 of emergency procedures to be taken in a contingency such as that which actually occurred, the Secret Service responded, quote,
LJ049-0054 The Secret Service has consistently followed two general principles in emergencies involving the President.
LJ049-0055 All agents are so instructed.
LJ049-0056 The first duty of the agents in the motorcade is to attempt to cover the President as closely as possible and practicable
LJ049-0057 and to shield him by attempting to place themselves between the President and any source of danger.
LJ049-0058 Secondly, agents are instructed to remove the President as quickly as possible from known or impending danger.
LJ049-0059 Agents are instructed that it is not their responsibility to investigate or evaluate a present danger,
LJ049-0060 but to consider any untoward circumstances as serious and to afford the President maximum protection at all times.
LJ049-0061 No responsibility rests upon those agents near the President for the identification or arrest of any assassin or an attacker.
LJ049-0062 Their primary responsibility is to stay with and protect the President.
LJ049-0063 Beyond these two principles the Secret Service believes a detailed contingency or emergency plan is not feasible
LJ049-0064 because the variations possible preclude effective planning.
LJ049-0065 A number of steps are taken, however, to permit appropriate steps to be taken in an emergency.
LJ049-0066 For instance, the lead car always is manned by Secret Service agents familiar with the area and with local law enforcement officials;
LJ049-0067 the radio net in use in motorcades is elaborate and permits a number of different means of communication with various local points.
LJ049-0068 A doctor is in the motorcade.
LJ049-0069 This basic approach to the problem of planning for emergencies is sound.
LJ049-0070 Any effort to prepare detailed contingency plans might well have the undesirable effect of inhibiting quick and imaginative responses.
LJ049-0071 If the advance preparation is thorough, and the protective devices and techniques employed are sound,
LJ049-0072 those in command should be able to direct the response appropriate to the emergency. The Commission finds that the Secret Service agents in the motorcade
LJ049-0073 who were immediately responsible for the President's safety reacted promptly at the time the shots were fired.
LJ049-0074 Their actions demonstrate that the President and the Nation can expect courage and devotion to duty from the agents of the Secret Service.
LJ049-0075 Recommendations.
LJ049-0076 The Commission's review of the provisions for Presidential protection at the time of President Kennedy's trip to Dallas demonstrates the need for substantial improvements.
LJ049-0077 Since the assassination, the Secret Service and the Department of the Treasury
LJ049-0078 have properly taken the initiative in reexamining major aspects of Presidential protection.
LJ049-0079 Many changes have already been made and others are contemplated, some of them in response to the Commission's questions and informal suggestions.
LJ049-0080 Assassination a Federal Crime
LJ049-0081 There was no Federal criminal jurisdiction over the assassination of President Kennedy.
LJ049-0082 Had there been reason to believe that the assassination was the result of a conspiracy, Federal jurisdiction could have been asserted;
LJ049-0083 it has long been a Federal crime to conspire to injure any Federal officer, on account of, or while he is engaged in, the lawful discharge of the duties of his office.
LJ049-0084 Murder of the President has never been covered by Federal law, however, so that once it became reasonably clear that the killing was the act of a single person,
LJ049-0085 the State of Texas had exclusive jurisdiction.
LJ049-0086 It is anomalous that Congress has legislated in other ways touching upon the safety of the Chief Executive or other Federal officers,
LJ049-0087 without making an attack on the President a crime. Threatening harm to the President is a Federal offense,
LJ049-0088 as is advocacy of the overthrow of the Government by the assassination of any of its officers.
LJ049-0089 The murder of Federal judges, U.S. attorneys and marshals, and a number of other specifically designated
LJ049-0090 Federal law enforcement officers is a Federal crime.
LJ049-0091 Equally anomalous are statutory provisions which specifically authorize the Secret Service to protect the President,
LJ049-0092 without authorizing it to arrest anyone who harms him. The same provisions authorize the Service to arrest without warrant
LJ049-0093 persons committing certain offenses, including counterfeiting and certain frauds involving Federal checks or securities.
LJ049-0094 The Commission agrees with the Secret Service that it should be authorized to make arrests without warrant
LJ049-0095 for all offenses within its jurisdiction, as are FBI agents and Federal marshals.
LJ049-0096 There have been a number of efforts to make assassination a Federal crime, particularly after the assassination of President McKinley
LJ049-0097 and the attempt on the life of President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt.
LJ049-0098 In nineteen oh two bills passed both Houses of Congress but failed of enactment when the Senate refused to accept the conference report.
LJ049-0099 A number of bills were introduced immediately following the assassination of President Kennedy.
LJ049-0100 The Commission recommends to the Congress that it adopt legislation which would:
LJ049-0101 Punish the murder or manslaughter of, attempt or conspiracy to murder, kidnaping of and assault upon
LJ049-0102 the President, Vice President, or other officer next in the order of succession to the Office of President, the President-elect and the Vice-President-elect,
LJ049-0103 whether or not the act is committed while the victim is in the performance of his official duties or on account of such performance.
LJ049-0104 Such a statute would cover the President and Vice President or, in the absence of a Vice President, the person next in order of succession.
LJ049-0105 During the period between election and inauguration, the President-elect and Vice-President-elect would also be covered.
LJ049-0106 Restricting the coverage in this way would avoid unnecessary controversy over the inclusion or exclusion of other officials who are in the order of succession
LJ049-0107 or who hold important governmental posts.
LJ049-0108 In addition, the restriction would probably eliminate a need for the requirement which has been urged as necessary for the exercise of Federal power,
LJ049-0109 that the hostile act occur while the victim is engaged in or because of the performance of official duties.
LJ049-0110 The governmental consequences of assassination of one of the specified officials give the United States ample power to act for its own protection.
LJ049-0111 The activities of the victim at the time an assassination occurs and the motive for the assassination
LJ049-0112 bear no relationship to the injury to the United States which follows from the act.
LJ049-0113 This point was ably made in the nineteen oh two debate by Senator George F. Hoar, the sponsor of the Senate bill, quote,
LJ049-0114 what this bill means to punish is the crime of interruption of the Government of the United States and the destruction of its security by striking down the life
LJ049-0115 of the person who is actually in the exercise of the executive power, or
LJ049-0116 of such persons as have been constitutionally and lawfully provided to succeed thereto in case of a vacancy. It is important to this country
LJ049-0117 that the interruption shall not take place for an hour, end quote.
LJ049-0118 Enactment of this statute would mean that the investigation of any of the acts covered and of the possibility of a further attempt
LJ049-0119 would be conducted by Federal law enforcement officials, in particular, the FBI with the assistance of the Secret Service.
LJ049-0120 At present, Federal agencies participate only upon the sufferance of the local authorities.
LJ049-0121 While the police work of the Dallas authorities in the early identification and apprehension of Oswald was both efficient and prompt,
LJ049-0122 FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who strongly supports such legislation, testified that the absence of clear Federal jurisdiction
LJ049-0123 over the assassination of President Kennedy led to embarrassment and confusion in the subsequent investigation by Federal and local authorities.
LJ049-0124 In addition, the proposed legislation will insure
LJ049-0125 that any suspects who are arrested will be Federal prisoners, subject to Federal protection from vigilante justice and other threats.
LJ049-0126 Committee of Cabinet Officers. As our Government has become more complex,
LJ049-0127 agencies other than the Secret Service have become involved in phases of the overall problem of protecting our national leaders.
LJ049-0128 The FBI is the major domestic investigating agency of the United States,
LJ049-0129 while the CIA has the primary responsibility for collecting intelligence overseas to supplement information acquired by the Department of State.
LJ049-0130 The Secret Service must rely in large part
LJ049-0132 The Commission believes that it is necessary to improve the cooperation among these agencies
LJ049-0133 and to emphasize that the task of Presidential protection is one of broad national concern.
LJ049-0134 The Commission suggests that consideration might be given to assigning to a Cabinet-level committee or the National Security Council
LJ049-0135 (which is responsible for advising the President respecting the coordination
LJ049-0136 of departmental policies relating to the national security) the responsibility to review and oversee the protective activities of the Secret Service
LJ049-0137 and the other Federal agencies that assist in safeguarding the President. The Committee should include the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General,
LJ049-0138 and, if the Council is used, arrangements should be made for the attendance of the Secretary of the Treasury
LJ049-0139 and the Attorney General at any meetings which are concerned with Presidential protection.
LJ049-0140 The Council already includes, in addition to the President and Vice President, the Secretaries of State and Defense and has a competent staff.
LJ049-0141 The foremost assignment of the Committee would be to insure that the maximum resources of the Federal Government are fully engaged in the job of protecting the President,
LJ049-0142 by defining responsibilities clearly and overseeing their execution.
LJ049-0143 Major needs of personnel or other resources might be met more easily on its recommendation than they have been in the past.
LJ049-0144 The Committee would be able to provide guidance in defining the general nature of domestic and foreign dangers to Presidential security.
LJ049-0145 As improvements are recommended for the advance detection of potential threats to the President, it could act as a final review board.
LJ049-0146 The expert assistance and resources which it could draw upon would be particularly desirable in this complex and sensitive area.
LJ049-0147 This arrangement would provide a continuing high-level contact for agencies that may wish to consult respecting particular protective measures.
LJ049-0148 For various reasons the Secret Service has functioned largely as an informal part of the White House staff, with the result
LJ049-0149 that it has been unable, as a practical matter, to exercise sufficient influence over the security precautions which surround Presidential activities.
LJ049-0150 A Cabinet-level committee which is actively concerned with these problems would be able to discuss these matters more effectively with the President.
LJ049-0151 Responsibilities for Presidential Protection
LJ049-0152 The assignment of the responsibility of protecting the President to an agency of the Department of the Treasury was largely an historical accident.
LJ049-0153 The Secret Service was organized as a division of the Department of the Treasury in eighteen sixty-five, to deal with counterfeiting.
LJ049-0154 In eighteen ninety-four,
LJ049-0155 while investigating a plot to assassinate President Cleveland, the Service assigned a small protective detail of agents to the White House.
LJ049-0156 Secret Service men accompanied the President and his family to their vacation home in Massachusetts
LJ049-0157 and special details protected him in Washington, on trips, and at special functions.
LJ049-0158 These informal and part-time arrangements led to more systematic protection in nineteen oh two, after the assassination of President McKinley;
LJ049-0159 the Secret Service, then the only Federal investigative agency, assumed full-time responsibility for the safety of the President.
LJ049-0160 Since that time, the Secret Service has had and exercised responsibility for the physical protection of the President
LJ049-0161 and also for the preventive investigation of potential threats against the President.
LJ049-0162 Although the Secret Service has had the primary responsibility for the protection of the President,
LJ049-0163 the FBI, which was established within the Department of Justice in nineteen oh eight, has had in recent years an increasingly important role to play.
LJ049-0164 In the appropriations of the FBI there has recurred annually an item for the, quote, protection of the person of the President of the United States, end quote,
LJ049-0165 which first appeared in the appropriation of the Department of Justice in nineteen ten under the heading, quote, Miscellaneous Objects, end quote.
LJ049-0166 Although the FBI is not charged with the physical protection of the President, it does have an assignment, as do other Government agencies,
LJ049-0167 in the field of preventive investigation in regard to the President's security.
LJ049-0168 As discussed above, the Bureau has attempted to meet its responsibilities in this field by spelling out in its Handbook
LJ049-0169 the procedures which its agents are to follow in connection with information received, quote,
LJ049-0170 indicating the possibility of an attempt against the person or safety of the President, end quote, or other protected persons.
LJ049-0171 With two Federal agencies operating in the same general field of preventive investigation,
LJ049-0172 questions inevitably arise as to the scope of each agency's authority and responsibility.
LJ049-0173 As the testimony of J. Edgar Hoover and other Bureau officials revealed, the FBI did not believe that its directive required the Bureau
LJ049-0174 to notify the Secret Service of the substantial information about Lee Harvey Oswald which the FBI had accumulated
LJ049-0175 before the President reached Dallas.
LJ049-0176 On the other hand, the Secret Service had no knowledge whatever of Oswald, his background, or his employment at the Book Depository,
LJ049-0177 and Robert I. Bouck, who was in charge of the Protective Research Section of the Secret Service, believed that the accumulation of the facts known to the FBI
LJ049-0178 should have constituted a sufficient basis to warn the Secret Service of the Oswald risk.
LJ049-0179 The Commission believes that both the FBI and the Secret Service have too narrowly construed their respective responsibilities.
LJ049-0180 The Commission has the impression
LJ049-0181 that too much emphasis is placed by both on the investigation of specific threats by individuals and not enough on dangers from other sources.
LJ049-0182 In addition, the Commission has concluded that the Secret Service particularly tends to be the passive recipient of information
LJ049-0183 regarding such threats and that its Protective Research Section is not adequately staffed or equipped
LJ049-0184 to conduct the wider investigative work that is required today for the security of the President.
LJ049-0185 During the period the Commission was giving thought to this situation,
LJ049-0186 the Commission received a number of proposals designed to improve current arrangements for protecting the President.
LJ049-0187 These proposals included suggestions to locate exclusive responsibility for all phases of the work
LJ049-0188 in one or another Government agency, to clarify the division of authority between the agencies involved, and to retain the existing system
LJ049-0189 but expand both the scope and the operations of the existing agencies, particularly those of the Secret Service and the FBI.
LJ049-0190 It has been pointed out that the FBI, as our chief investigative agency,
LJ049-0191 is properly manned and equipped to carry on extensive information gathering functions within the United States.
LJ049-0192 It was also suggested that it would take a substantial period of time for the Secret Service to build up the experience and skills necessary to meet the problem.
LJ049-0193 Consequently the suggestion has been made, on the one hand, that all preventive investigative functions relating to the security of the President
LJ049-0194 should be transferred to the FBI,
LJ049-0195 leaving with the Secret Service only the responsibility for the physical protection of the President, that is, the guarding function alone.
LJ049-0196 On the other hand, it is urged that all features of the protection of the President and his family should be committed to an elite and independent corps.
LJ049-0197 It is also contended that the agents should be intimately associated with the life of the Presidential family
LJ049-0198 in all its ramifications and alert to every danger that might befall it,
LJ049-0199 and ready at any instant to hazard great danger to themselves in the performance of their tremendous responsibility.
LJ049-0200 It is suggested that an organization shorn of its power to investigate all the possibilities of danger to the President
LJ049-0201 and becoming merely the recipient of information gathered by others would become limited solely to acts of physical alertness and personal courage
LJ049-0202 incident to its responsibilities.
LJ049-0203 So circumscribed, it could not maintain the esprit de corps or the necessary alertness for this unique and challenging responsibility.
LJ049-0204 While in accordance with its mandate
LJ049-0205 this Commission has necessarily examined into the functioning of the various Federal agencies concerned with the tragic trip of President Kennedy to Dallas
LJ049-0206 and while it has arrived at certain conclusions in respect thereto, it seems clear
LJ049-0207 that it was not within the Commission's responsibility to make specific recommendations as to the long-range organization of the President's protection,
LJ049-0208 except as conclusions flowing directly from its examination of the President's assassination can be drawn.
LJ049-0209 The Commission was not asked to apply itself as did the Hoover Commission in nineteen forty-nine,
LJ049-0210 for examples to a determination of the optimum organization of the President's protection.
LJ049-0211 It would have been necessary for the Commission to take considerable testimony, much of it extraneous to the facts of the assassination of President Kennedy,
LJ049-0212 to put it in a position to reach final conclusions in this respect.
LJ049-0213 There are always dangers of divided responsibility,
LJ049-0214 duplication, and confusion of authority where more than one agency is operating in the same field; but on the other hand
LJ049-0215 the protection of the President is in a real sense a Government-wide responsibility which must necessarily assumed by the Department of State,
LJ049-0216 the FBI, the CIA, and the military intelligence agencies as well as the Secret Service.
LJ049-0217 Moreover, a number of imponderable questions have to be weighed if any change in the intimate association now established
LJ049-0218 between the Secret Service and the President and his family is contemplated.
LJ049-0219 These considerations have induced the Commission to believe
LJ049-0220 that the determination of whether or not there should be a relocation of responsibilities and functions should be left to the Executive and the Congress,
LJ049-0221 perhaps upon recommendations based on further studies by the Cabinet-level committee recommended above or the National Security Council.
LJ049-0222 Pending any such determination, however, this Commission is convinced of the necessity of better coordination
LJ049-0223 and direction of the activities of all existing agencies of Government which are in a position to and do, furnish information
LJ049-0224 and services related to the security of the President.
LJ049-0225 The Commission feels the Secret Service and the FBI, as well as the State Department and the CIA when the President travels abroad,
LJ049-0226 could improve their existing capacities and procedures so as to lessen the chances of assassination.
LJ049-0227 Without, therefore, coming to final conclusions respecting the long-range organization of the President's security,
LJ049-0228 the Commission believes that the facts of the assassination of President Kennedy point to certain measures which,
LJ049-0229 while assuming no radical relocation of responsibilities,
LJ049-0230 can and should be recommended by this Commission in the interest of the more efficient protection of the President.

LJ050-0002 The Warren Commission Report.
LJ050-0003 By The President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy. Chapter eight. The Protection of the President. Part five.
LJ050-0004 General Supervision of the Secret Service
LJ050-0005 The intimacy of the Secret Service's relationship to the White House
LJ050-0006 and the dissimilarity of its protective functions to most activities of the Department of the Treasury
LJ050-0007 have made it difficult for the Treasury to maintain close and continuing supervision.
LJ050-0008 The Commission believes that the recommended Cabinet-level committee will help to correct many of the major deficiencies of supervision
LJ050-0009 disclosed by the Commission's investigation. Other measures should be taken as well to improve the overall operation of the Secret Service.
LJ050-0010 Daily supervision of the operations of the Secret Service within the Department of the Treasury should be improved.
LJ050-0011 The Chief of the Service now reports to the Secretary of the Treasury
LJ050-0012 through an Assistant Secretary whose duties also include the direct supervision of the Bureau of the Mint
LJ050-0013 and the Department's Employment Policy Program, and who also represents the Secretary of the Treasury on various committees and groups.
LJ050-0014 The incumbent has no technical qualifications in the area of Presidential protection.
LJ050-0015 The Commission recommends that the Secretary of the Treasury appoint a special assistant with the responsibility of supervising the Service.
LJ050-0016 This special assistant should be required to have sufficient stature and experience in law enforcement, intelligence, or allied fields
LJ050-0017 to be able to provide effective continuing supervision
LJ050-0018 and to keep the Secretary fully informed regarding all significant developments relating to Presidential protection.
LJ050-0019 This report has already pointed out several respects
LJ050-0020 in which the Commission believes that the Secret Service has operated with insufficient planning or control.
LJ050-0021 Actions by the Service since the assassination indicate its awareness of the necessity for substantial improvement in its administration.
LJ050-0022 A formal and thorough description of the responsibilities of the advance agent is now in preparation by the Service.
LJ050-0023 Work is going forward
LJ050-0024 toward the preparation of formal understandings of the respective roles of the Secret Service and other agencies with which it collaborates
LJ050-0025 or from which it derives assistance and support.
LJ050-0026 The Commission urges that the Service continue this effort to overhaul and define its procedures.
LJ050-0027 While manuals and memoranda are no guarantee of effective operations,
LJ050-0028 no sizable organization can achieve efficiency without the careful analysis and demarcation of responsibility
LJ050-0029 that is reflected in definite and comprehensive operating procedures.
LJ050-0030 The Commission also recommends
LJ050-0031 that the Secret Service consciously set about the task of inculcating and maintaining the highest standard of excellence and esprit, for all of its personnel.
LJ050-0032 This involves tight and unswerving discipline as well as the promotion of an outstanding degree of dedication and loyalty to duty.
LJ050-0033 The Commission emphasizes that it finds no causal connection between the assassination
LJ050-0034 and the breach of regulations which occurred on the night of November twenty-one at Fort Worth.
LJ050-0035 Nevertheless, such a breach, in which so many agents participated,
LJ050-0036 is not consistent with the standards which the responsibilities of the Secret Service require it to meet.
LJ050-0037 Preventive Intelligence
LJ050-0038 In attempting to identify those individuals who might prove a danger to the President,
LJ050-0039 the Secret Service has largely been the passive recipient of threatening communications to the President
LJ050-0040 and reports from other agencies which independently evaluate their information for potential sources of danger.
LJ050-0041 This was the consequence of the Service's lack of an adequate investigative staff,
LJ050-0042 its inability to process large amounts of data, and its failure to provide specific descriptions of the kind of information it sought.
LJ050-0043 The Secret Service has embarked upon a complete overhaul of its research activities. The staff of the Protective Research Section (PRS)
LJ050-0044 has been augmented, and a Secret Service inspector has been put in charge of this operation. With the assistance of the President's Office of Science and Technology,
LJ050-0045 and of the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense,
LJ050-0046 it has obtained the services of outside consultants, such as the Rand Corporation,
LJ050-0047 International Business Machines Corporation, and a panel of psychiatric and psychological experts.
LJ050-0048 It has received assistance also from data processing experts at the CIA
LJ050-0049 and from a specialist in psychiatric prognostication at Walter Reed Hospital.
LJ050-0050 As a result of these studies, the planning document submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Bureau of the Budget on August thirty-one,
LJ050-0051 nineteen sixty-four, makes several significant recommendations in this field.
LJ050-0052 Based on the Commission's investigation, the following minimum goals for improvements are indicated:
LJ050-0053 Broader and more selective criteria
LJ050-0054 Since the assassination, both the Secret Service and the FBI have recognized
LJ050-0055 that the PRS files can no longer be limited largely to persons communicating actual threats to the President.
LJ050-0056 On December twenty-six, nineteen sixty-three, the FBI circulated additional instructions to all its agents,
LJ050-0057 specifying criteria for information to be furnished to the Secret Service in addition to that covered by the former standard,
LJ050-0058 which was the possibility of an attempt against the person or safety of the President.
LJ050-0059 he new instructions require FBI agents to report immediately information concerning, quote,
LJ050-0060 Subversives, ultrarightists, racists and fascists (a) possessing emotional instability or irrational behavior,
LJ050-0061 (b) who have made threats of bodily harm against officials or employees of Federal, state or local government or officials of a foreign government,
LJ050-0062 (c) who express or have expressed strong or violent anti-U.S. sentiments
LJ050-0063 and who have been involved in bombing or bomb-making or whose past conduct indicates tendencies toward violence, and (d)
LJ050-0064 whose prior acts or statements depict propensity for violence and hatred against organized government, end quote.
LJ050-0065 Alan H. Belmont, Assistant to the Director of the FBI, testified that this revision was initiated by the FBI itself.
LJ050-0066 The volume of references to the Secret Service has increased substantially since the new instructions went into effect;
LJ050-0067 more than five thousand names were referred to the Secret Service in the first four months of nineteen sixty-four.
LJ050-0068 According to Chief Rowley, by mid-June nineteen sixty-four,
LJ050-0069 the Secret Service had received from the FBI some nine thousand reports on members of the Communist Party.
LJ050-0070 The FBI now transmits information on all defectors, a category which would, of course, have included Oswald.
LJ050-0071 Both Director Hoover and Belmont expressed to the Commission the great concern of the FBI, which is shared by the Secret Service,
LJ050-0072 that referrals to the Secret Service under the new criteria might, if not properly handled,
LJ050-0073 result in some degree of interference with the personal liberty of those involved.
LJ050-0074 They emphasized the necessity that the information now being furnished be handled with judgment and care.
LJ050-0075 The Commission shares this concern.
LJ050-0076 The problem is aggravated by the necessity that the Service obtain the assistance of local law enforcement officials in evaluating the information which it receives
LJ050-0077 and in taking preventive steps.
LJ050-0078 In June nineteen sixty-four, the Secret Service sent to a number of Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies
LJ050-0079 guidelines for an experimental program to develop more detailed criteria.
LJ050-0080 The suggestions of Federal agencies for revision of these guidelines were solicited.
LJ050-0081 The new tentative criteria are useful in making clear that
LJ050-0082 the interest of the Secret Service goes beyond information on individuals or groups threatening to cause harm or embarrassment to the President.
LJ050-0083 Information is requested also concerning individuals or groups who have demonstrated an interest in the President
LJ050-0084 or, quote, other high government officials in the nature of a complaint coupled with an expressed or implied determination to use a means,
LJ050-0085 other than legal or peaceful, to satisfy any grievance, real or imagined.
LJ050-0086 Under these criteria, whether the case should be referred to the Secret Service depends on the existence of a previous history of mental instability,
LJ050-0087 propensity toward violent action, or some similar characteristic, coupled with some evaluation of the capability of the individual or group
LJ050-0088 to further the intention to satisfy a grievance by unlawful means.
LJ050-0089 While these tentative criteria are a step in the right direction,
LJ050-0090 they seem unduly restrictive in continuing to require some manifestation of animus against a Government official.
LJ050-0091 It is questionable whether such criteria would have resulted in the referral of Oswald to the Secret Service.
LJ050-0092 Chief Rowley believed that they would,
LJ050-0093 because of Oswald's demonstrated hostility toward the Secretary of the Navy in his letter of January thirty, nineteen sixty-two. Quote,
LJ050-0094 I shall employ all means to right this gross mistake or injustice to a bona fide U.S. citizen and ex-service man.
LJ050-0095 The U.S. government has no charges or complaints against me.
LJ050-0096 I ask you to look into this case and take the necessary steps to repair the damage done to me and my family. End quote.
LJ050-0097 Even with the advantage of hindsight, this letter does not appear to express or imply Oswald's, quote,
LJ050-0098 determination to use a means, other than legal or peaceful, to satisfy his grievance, end quote, within the meaning of the new criteria.
LJ050-0099 It is apparent that a good deal of further consideration and experimentation will be required before adequate criteria can be framed.
LJ050-0100 The Commission recognizes that no set of meaningful criteria will yield the names of all potential assassins. Charles J. Guiteau,
LJ050-0101 Leon F. Czolgosz,
LJ050-0102 John Schrank, and Guiseppe Zangara -- four assassins or would-be assassins
LJ050-0103 were all men who acted alone in their criminal acts against our leaders. None had a serious record of prior violence.
LJ050-0104 Each of them was a failure in his work and in his relations with others, a victim of delusions and fancies which led to the conviction
LJ050-0105 that society and its leaders had combined to thwart him. It will require every available resource of our Government
LJ050-0106 to devise a practical system which has any reasonable possibility of revealing such malcontents.
LJ050-0107 Liaison with other agencies regarding intelligence.
LJ050-0108 The Secret Service's liaison with the agencies that supply information to it has been too casual.
LJ050-0109 Since the assassination, the Service has recognized that these relationships must be far more formal
LJ050-0110 and each agency given clear understanding of the assistance which the Secret Service expects.
LJ050-0111 Once the Secret Service has formulated its new standards for collection of information, it should enter into written agreements with each Federal agency
LJ050-0112 and the leading State and local agencies that might be a source of such information.
LJ050-0113 Such agreements should describe in detail the information which is sought, the manner in which it will be provided to the Secret Service,
LJ050-0114 and the respective responsibilities for any further investigation that may be required.
LJ050-0115 This is especially necessary with regard to the FBI and CIA,
LJ050-0116 which carry the major responsibility for supplying information about potential threats,
LJ050-0117 particularly those arising from organized groups, within their special jurisdiction.
LJ050-0118 Since these agencies are already obliged constantly to evaluate the activities of such groups,
LJ050-0119 they should be responsible for advising the Secret Service if information develops indicating the existence of an assassination plot
LJ050-0120 and for reporting such events as a change in leadership or dogma which indicate that the group may present a danger to the President.
LJ050-0121 Detailed formal agreements embodying these arrangements should be worked out between the Secret Service and both of these agencies.
LJ050-0122 It should be made clear that the Secret Service will in no way seek to duplicate the intelligence
LJ050-0123 and investigative capabilities of the agencies now operating in this field but will continue
LJ050-0124 to use the data developed by these agencies to carry out its special duties.
LJ050-0125 Once experience has been gained in implementing such agreements with the Federal and leading State and local agencies,
LJ050-0126 the Secret Service, through its field offices,
LJ050-0127 should negotiate similar arrangements with such other State and local law enforcement agencies as may provide meaningful assistance.
LJ050-0128 Much useful information will come to the attention of local law enforcement agencies in the regular course of their activities,
LJ050-0129 and this source should not be neglected by undue concentration on relationships with other Federal agencies.
LJ050-0130 Finally, these agreements with Federal and local authorities will be of little value
LJ050-0131 unless a system is established for the frequent formal review of activities thereunder. In this regard
LJ050-0132 the Commission notes with approval several recent measures taken and proposed by the Secret Service to improve its liaison arrangements.
LJ050-0133 In his testimony Secretary of the Treasury C. Douglas Dillon informed the Commission
LJ050-0134 that an interagency committee has been established to develop more effective criteria.
LJ050-0135 According to Secretary Dillon,
LJ050-0136 the Committee will include representatives of the President's Office of Science and Technology, Department of Defense, CIA,
LJ050-0137 FBI, and the Secret Service.
LJ050-0138 In addition, the Department of the Treasury has requested five additional agents for its Protective Research Section
LJ050-0139 to serve as liaison officers with law enforcement and intelligence agencies. On the basis of the Department's review during the past several months,
LJ050-0140 Secretary Dillon testified that the use of such liaison officers is the only effective way to insure that adequate liaison is maintained.
LJ050-0141 As a beginning step to improve liaison with local law enforcement officials, the Secret Service on August twenty-six, nineteen sixty-four,
LJ050-0142 directed its field representatives to send a form request for intelligence information to all local,
LJ050-0143 county, and State law enforcement agencies in their districts.
LJ050-0144 Each of these efforts appears sound,
LJ050-0145 and the Commission recommends that these and the other measures suggested by the Commission be pursued vigorously by Secret Service.
LJ050-0146 Automatic data processing
LJ050-0147 Unless the Secret Service is able to deal rapidly and accurately with a growing body of data,
LJ050-0148 the increased information supplied by other agencies will be wasted.
LJ050-0149 PRS must develop the capacity to classify its subjects on a more sophisticated basis than the present geographic breakdown.
LJ050-0150 Its present manual filing system is obsolete;
LJ050-0151 it makes no use of the recent developments in automatic data processing which are widely used in the business world and in other Government offices.
LJ050-0152 The Secret Service and the Department of the Treasury now recognize this critical need.
LJ050-0153 In the planning document currently under review by the Bureau of the Budget, the Department recommends that it be permitted to hire five qualified persons, quote,
LJ050-0154 to plan and develop a workable and efficient automated file and retrieval system, end quote.
LJ050-0155 Also the Department requests the sum of one hundred thousand dollars to conduct a detailed feasibility study;
LJ050-0156 this money would be used to compensate consultants, to lease standard equipment or to purchase specially designed pilot equipment.
LJ050-0157 On the basis of such a feasibility study,
LJ050-0158 the Department hopes to design a practical system which will fully meet the needs of the Protective Research Section of the Secret Service.
LJ050-0159 The Commission recommends that prompt and favorable consideration be given to this request.
LJ050-0160 The Commission further recommends that the Secret Service coordinate its planning as closely as possible with all of the Federal agencies from which it receives information.
LJ050-0161 The Secret Service should not and does not plan to develop its own intelligence gathering facilities to duplicate the existing facilities of other Federal agencies.
LJ050-0162 In planning its data processing techniques,
LJ050-0163 the Secret Service should attempt to develop a system compatible with those of the agencies from which most of its data will come. Note:
LJ050-0164 In evaluating data processing techniques of the Secret Service,
LJ050-0165 the Commission had occasion to become informed, to a limited extent, about the data processing techniques of other Federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies.
LJ050-0166 The Commission was struck by the apparent lack of effort, on an interagency basis,
LJ050-0167 to develop coordinated and mutually compatible systems, even where such coordination would not seem inconsistent
LJ050-0168 with the particular purposes of the agency involved. The Commission recognizes that this is a controversial area
LJ050-0169 and that many strongly held views are advanced in resistance to any suggestion that an effort be made to impose any degree of coordination.
LJ050-0170 This matter is obviously beyond the jurisdiction of the Commission,
LJ050-0171 but it seems to warrant further study before each agency becomes irrevocably committed to separate action.
LJ050-0172 The Commission, therefore, recommends that the President consider ordering an inquiry into the possibility
LJ050-0173 that coordination might be achieved to a greater extent than seems now to be contemplated, without interference with the primary mission of each agency involved.
LJ050-0174 Protective Research participation in advance arrangements.
LJ050-0175 Since the assassination, Secret Service procedures have been changed to require that a member of PRS accompany each advance survey team
LJ050-0176 to establish liaison with local intelligence gathering agencies and to provide for the immediate evaluation of information received from them.
LJ050-0177 This PRS agent will also be responsible for establishing an informal local liaison committee
LJ050-0178 to make certain that all protective intelligence activities are coordinated.
LJ050-0179 Based on its experience during this period, the Secret Service now recommends that additional personnel be made available to PRS
LJ050-0180 so that these arrangements can be made permanent without adversely affecting the operations of the Service's field offices.
LJ050-0181 The Commission regards this as a most useful innovation and urges that the practice be continued.
LJ050-0182 Liaison With Local Law Enforcement Agencies
LJ050-0183 Advice by the Secret Service to local police in metropolitan areas relating to the assistance expected in connection with a Presidential visit
LJ050-0184 has hitherto been handled on an informal basis.
LJ050-0185 The Service should consider preparing formal explanations of the cooperation anticipated during a Presidential visit to a city,
LJ050-0186 in formats that can be communicated to each level of local authorities.
LJ050-0187 Thus, the local chief of police could be given a master plan, prepared for the occasion, of all protective measures to be taken during the visit;
LJ050-0188 each patrolman might be given a prepared booklet of instructions explaining what is expected of him. The Secret Service has expressed concern
LJ050-0189 that written instructions might come into the hands of local newspapers, to the prejudice of the precautions described.
LJ050-0190 However, the instructions must be communicated to the local police in any event and can be leaked to the press whether or not they are in writing.
LJ050-0191 More importantly, the lack of carefully prepared and carefully transmitted instructions for typical visits to cities
LJ050-0192 can lead to lapses in protection, such as the confusion in Dallas about whether members of the public were permitted on overpasses.
LJ050-0193 Such instructions will not fit all circumstances, of course,
LJ050-0194 and should not be relied upon to the detriment of the imaginative application of judgment in special cases.
LJ050-0195 Inspection of Buildings
LJ050-0196 Since the assassination of President Kennedy, the Secret Service has been experimenting with new techniques in the inspection of buildings along a motorcade route.
LJ050-0197 According to Secretary Dillon,
LJ050-0198 the studies indicate that there is some utility in attempting to designate certain buildings as involving a higher risk than others.
LJ050-0199 The Commission strongly encourages these efforts to improve protection along a motorcade route.
LJ050-0200 The Secret Service should utilize the personnel of other Federal law enforcement offices
LJ050-0201 in the locality to assure adequate manpower for this task, as it is now doing.
LJ050-0202 Lack of adequate resources is an unacceptable excuse for failing to improve advance precautions
LJ050-0203 in this crucial area of Presidential protection.
LJ050-0204 Secret Service Personnel and Facilities
LJ050-0205 Testimony and other evidence before the Commission
LJ050-0206 suggest that the Secret Service is trying to accomplish its job with too few people and without adequate modern equipment.
LJ050-0207 Although Chief Rowley does not complain about the pay scale for Secret Service agents,
LJ050-0208 salaries are below those of the FBI and leading municipal police forces.
LJ050-0209 The assistant to the Director of the FBI testified that
LJ050-0210 the caseload of each FBI agent averaged twenty to twenty-five, and he felt that this was high.
LJ050-0211 Chief Rowley testified that the present workload of each Secret Service agent averages one hundred ten point one cases.
LJ050-0212 While these statistics relate to the activities of Secret Service agents stationed in field offices and not the White House detail,
LJ050-0213 field agents supplement those on the detail, particularly when the President is traveling.
LJ050-0214 Although the Commission does not know whether the cases involved are entirely comparable,
LJ050-0215 these figures suggest that the agents of the Secret Service are substantially overworked.
LJ050-0216 In its budget request for the fiscal year beginning July one, nineteen sixty-four,
LJ050-0217 the Secret Service sought funds for twenty-five new positions, primarily in field offices. This increase has been approved by the Congress.
LJ050-0218 Chief Rowley explained that this would not provide enough additional manpower to take all the measures which he considers required.
LJ050-0219 However, the nineteen sixty-four to sixty-five budget request was submitted in November nineteen sixty-three
LJ050-0220 and requests for additional personnel were not made because of the studies then being conducted.
LJ050-0221 The Secret Service has now presented its recommendations to the Bureau of the Budget. The plan proposed by the Service
LJ050-0222 would take approximately twenty months to implement and require expenditures of approximately three million dollars during that period.
LJ050-0223 The plan provides for an additional two hundred five agents for the Secret Service. Seventeen of this number are proposed for the Protective Research Section;
LJ050-0224 one hundred forty-five are proposed for the field offices to handle the increased volume of security investigations
LJ050-0225 and be available to protect the President or Vice President when they travel;
LJ050-0226 eighteen agents are proposed for a rotating pool which will go through an intensive training cycle and also be available to supplement the White House detail
LJ050-0227 in case of unexpected need; and twenty-five additional agents are recommended to provide the Vice President full protection.
LJ050-0228 The Commission urges that the Bureau of the Budget review these recommendations with the Secret Service and authorize a request for the necessary supplemental appropriation,
LJ050-0229 as soon as it can be justified. The Congress has often stressed that it will support any reasonable request for funds for the protection of the President.
LJ050-0230 Manpower and Technical Assistance From Other Agencies
LJ050-0231 Before the assassination the Secret Service infrequently requested other Federal law enforcement agencies to provide personnel
LJ050-0232 to assist in its protection functions.
LJ050-0233 Since the assassination, the Service has experimented with the use of agents borrowed for short periods from such agencies.
LJ050-0234 It has used other Treasury law enforcement agents on special experiments in building and route surveys in places to which the President frequently travels.
LJ050-0235 It has also used other Federal law enforcement agents during Presidential visits to cities in which such agents are stationed.
LJ050-0236 Thus, in the four months following the assassination,
LJ050-0237 the FBI, on sixteen separate occasions, supplied a total of one hundred thirty-nine agents to assist in protection work during a Presidential visit,
LJ050-0238 which represents a departure from its prior practice.
LJ050-0239 From February eleven through June thirty, nineteen sixty-four,
LJ050-0240 the Service had the advantage of nine thousand, five hundred hours of work by other enforcement agencies.
LJ050-0241 The FBI has indicated that it is willing to continue to make such assistance available,
LJ050-0242 even though it agrees with the Secret Service that it is preferable for the Service to have enough agents to handle all protective demands.
LJ050-0243 The Commission endorses these efforts to supplement the Service's own personnel by obtaining, for short periods of time,
LJ050-0244 the assistance of trained Federal law enforcement officers.
LJ050-0245 In view of the ever-increasing mobility of American Presidents, it seems unlikely that the Service could or should increase its own staff to a size
LJ050-0246 which would permit it to provide adequate protective manpower for all situations.
LJ050-0247 The Commission recommends that the agencies involved determine how much periodic assistance they can provide, and that each such agency
LJ050-0248 and the Secret Service enter into a formal agreement defining such arrangements.
LJ050-0249 It may eventually be desirable to codify the practice in an Executive order.
LJ050-0250 The Secret Service will be better able to plan its own long-range personnel requirements if it knows with reasonable certainty
LJ050-0251 the amount of assistance that it can expect from other agencies.
LJ050-0252 The occasional use of personnel from other Federal agencies to assist in protecting the President has a further advantage. It symbolizes the reality
LJ050-0253 that the job of protecting the President has not been and cannot be exclusively the responsibility of the Secret Service.
LJ050-0254 The Secret Service in the past has sometimes guarded its right to be acknowledged as the sole protector of the Chief Executive.
LJ050-0255 This no longer appears to be the case.
LJ050-0256 Protecting the President is a difficult and complex task which requires full use of the best resources of many parts of our Government.
LJ050-0257 Recognition that the responsibility must be shared increases the likelihood that it will be met.
LJ050-0258 Much of the Secret Service work requires the development and use of highly sophisticated equipment,
LJ050-0259 some of which must be specially designed to fit unique requirements. Even before the assassination, and to a far greater extent thereafter,
LJ050-0260 the Secret Service has been receiving full cooperation in scientific research and technological development
LJ050-0261 from many Government agencies including the Department of Defense and the President's Office of Science and Technology.
LJ050-0262 Even if the manpower and technological resources of the Secret Service are adequately augmented,
LJ050-0263 it will continue to rely in many respects upon the greater resources of the Office of Science and Technology and other agencies.
LJ050-0264 The Commission recommends that the present arrangements
LJ050-0265 with the Office of Science and Technology and the other Federal agencies that have been so helpful to the Secret Service be placed on a permanent and formal basis.
LJ050-0266 The exchange of letters dated August thirty-one, nineteen sixty-four,
LJ050-0267 between Secretary Dillon and Donald F. Hornig, Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, is a useful effort in the right direction.
LJ050-0268 The Service should negotiate a memorandum of understanding with each agency that has been assisting it and from which it can expect to need help in the future.
LJ050-0269 The essential terms of such memoranda might well be embodied in an Executive order.
LJ050-0270 This Commission can recommend no procedures for the future protection of our Presidents which will guarantee security.
LJ050-0271 The demands on the President in the execution of His responsibilities in today's world are so varied and complex
LJ050-0272 and the traditions of the office in a democracy such as ours are so deep-seated as to preclude absolute security.
LJ050-0273 The Commission has, however, from its examination of the facts of President Kennedy's assassination
LJ050-0274 made certain recommendations which it believes would, if adopted,
LJ050-0275 materially improve upon the procedures in effect at the time of President Kennedy's assassination and result in a substantial lessening of the danger.
LJ050-0276 As has been pointed out, the Commission has not resolved all the proposals which could be made. The Commission nevertheless is confident that,
LJ050-0277 with the active cooperation of the responsible agencies and with the understanding of the people of the United States in their demands upon their President,
LJ050-0278 the recommendations we have here suggested would greatly advance the security of the office without any impairment of our fundamental liberties.
