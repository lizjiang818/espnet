LJ050-0029 that is reflected in definite and comprehensive operating procedures.
LJ050-0030 The Commission also recommends
LJ050-0031 that the Secret Service consciously set about the task of inculcating and maintaining the highest standard of excellence and esprit, for all of its personnel.
LJ050-0032 This involves tight and unswerving discipline as well as the promotion of an outstanding degree of dedication and loyalty to duty.
LJ050-0033 The Commission emphasizes that it finds no causal connection between the assassination
LJ050-0034 and the breach of regulations which occurred on the night of November twenty-one at Fort Worth.
LJ050-0035 Nevertheless, such a breach, in which so many agents participated,
LJ050-0036 is not consistent with the standards which the responsibilities of the Secret Service require it to meet.
LJ050-0037 Preventive Intelligence
LJ050-0038 In attempting to identify those individuals who might prove a danger to the President,
LJ050-0039 the Secret Service has largely been the passive recipient of threatening communications to the President
LJ050-0040 and reports from other agencies which independently evaluate their information for potential sources of danger.
LJ050-0041 This was the consequence of the Service's lack of an adequate investigative staff,
LJ050-0042 its inability to process large amounts of data, and its failure to provide specific descriptions of the kind of information it sought.
LJ050-0043 The Secret Service has embarked upon a complete overhaul of its research activities. The staff of the Protective Research Section (PRS)
LJ050-0044 has been augmented, and a Secret Service inspector has been put in charge of this operation. With the assistance of the President's Office of Science and Technology,
LJ050-0045 and of the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense,
LJ050-0046 it has obtained the services of outside consultants, such as the Rand Corporation,
LJ050-0047 International Business Machines Corporation, and a panel of psychiatric and psychological experts.
LJ050-0048 It has received assistance also from data processing experts at the CIA
LJ050-0049 and from a specialist in psychiatric prognostication at Walter Reed Hospital.
LJ050-0050 As a result of these studies, the planning document submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Bureau of the Budget on August thirty-one,
LJ050-0051 nineteen sixty-four, makes several significant recommendations in this field.
LJ050-0052 Based on the Commission's investigation, the following minimum goals for improvements are indicated:
LJ050-0053 Broader and more selective criteria
LJ050-0054 Since the assassination, both the Secret Service and the FBI have recognized
LJ050-0055 that the PRS files can no longer be limited largely to persons communicating actual threats to the President.
LJ050-0056 On December twenty-six, nineteen sixty-three, the FBI circulated additional instructions to all its agents,
LJ050-0057 specifying criteria for information to be furnished to the Secret Service in addition to that covered by the former standard,
LJ050-0058 which was the possibility of an attempt against the person or safety of the President.
LJ050-0059 he new instructions require FBI agents to report immediately information concerning, quote,
LJ050-0060 Subversives, ultrarightists, racists and fascists (a) possessing emotional instability or irrational behavior,
LJ050-0061 (b) who have made threats of bodily harm against officials or employees of Federal, state or local government or officials of a foreign government,
LJ050-0062 (c) who express or have expressed strong or violent anti-U.S. sentiments
LJ050-0063 and who have been involved in bombing or bomb-making or whose past conduct indicates tendencies toward violence, and (d)
LJ050-0064 whose prior acts or statements depict propensity for violence and hatred against organized government, end quote.
LJ050-0065 Alan H. Belmont, Assistant to the Director of the FBI, testified that this revision was initiated by the FBI itself.
LJ050-0066 The volume of references to the Secret Service has increased substantially since the new instructions went into effect;
LJ050-0067 more than five thousand names were referred to the Secret Service in the first four months of nineteen sixty-four.
LJ050-0068 According to Chief Rowley, by mid-June nineteen sixty-four,
LJ050-0069 the Secret Service had received from the FBI some nine thousand reports on members of the Communist Party.
LJ050-0070 The FBI now transmits information on all defectors, a category which would, of course, have included Oswald.
LJ050-0071 Both Director Hoover and Belmont expressed to the Commission the great concern of the FBI, which is shared by the Secret Service,
LJ050-0072 that referrals to the Secret Service under the new criteria might, if not properly handled,
LJ050-0073 result in some degree of interference with the personal liberty of those involved.
LJ050-0074 They emphasized the necessity that the information now being furnished be handled with judgment and care.
LJ050-0075 The Commission shares this concern.
LJ050-0076 The problem is aggravated by the necessity that the Service obtain the assistance of local law enforcement officials in evaluating the information which it receives
LJ050-0077 and in taking preventive steps.
LJ050-0078 In June nineteen sixty-four, the Secret Service sent to a number of Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies
LJ050-0079 guidelines for an experimental program to develop more detailed criteria.
LJ050-0080 The suggestions of Federal agencies for revision of these guidelines were solicited.
LJ050-0081 The new tentative criteria are useful in making clear that
LJ050-0082 the interest of the Secret Service goes beyond information on individuals or groups threatening to cause harm or embarrassment to the President.
LJ050-0083 Information is requested also concerning individuals or groups who have demonstrated an interest in the President
LJ050-0084 or, quote, other high government officials in the nature of a complaint coupled with an expressed or implied determination to use a means,
LJ050-0085 other than legal or peaceful, to satisfy any grievance, real or imagined.
LJ050-0086 Under these criteria, whether the case should be referred to the Secret Service depends on the existence of a previous history of mental instability,
LJ050-0087 propensity toward violent action, or some similar characteristic, coupled with some evaluation of the capability of the individual or group
LJ050-0088 to further the intention to satisfy a grievance by unlawful means.
LJ050-0089 While these tentative criteria are a step in the right direction,
LJ050-0090 they seem unduly restrictive in continuing to require some manifestation of animus against a Government official.
LJ050-0091 It is questionable whether such criteria would have resulted in the referral of Oswald to the Secret Service.
LJ050-0092 Chief Rowley believed that they would,
LJ050-0093 because of Oswald's demonstrated hostility toward the Secretary of the Navy in his letter of January thirty, nineteen sixty-two. Quote,
LJ050-0094 I shall employ all means to right this gross mistake or injustice to a bona fide U.S. citizen and ex-service man.
LJ050-0095 The U.S. government has no charges or complaints against me.
LJ050-0096 I ask you to look into this case and take the necessary steps to repair the damage done to me and my family. End quote.
LJ050-0097 Even with the advantage of hindsight, this letter does not appear to express or imply Oswald's, quote,
LJ050-0098 determination to use a means, other than legal or peaceful, to satisfy his grievance, end quote, within the meaning of the new criteria.
LJ050-0099 It is apparent that a good deal of further consideration and experimentation will be required before adequate criteria can be framed.
LJ050-0100 The Commission recognizes that no set of meaningful criteria will yield the names of all potential assassins. Charles J. Guiteau,
LJ050-0101 Leon F. Czolgosz,
LJ050-0102 John Schrank, and Guiseppe Zangara -- four assassins or would-be assassins
LJ050-0103 were all men who acted alone in their criminal acts against our leaders. None had a serious record of prior violence.
LJ050-0104 Each of them was a failure in his work and in his relations with others, a victim of delusions and fancies which led to the conviction
LJ050-0105 that society and its leaders had combined to thwart him. It will require every available resource of our Government
LJ050-0106 to devise a practical system which has any reasonable possibility of revealing such malcontents.
LJ050-0107 Liaison with other agencies regarding intelligence.
LJ050-0108 The Secret Service's liaison with the agencies that supply information to it has been too casual.
LJ050-0109 Since the assassination, the Service has recognized that these relationships must be far more formal
LJ050-0110 and each agency given clear understanding of the assistance which the Secret Service expects.
LJ050-0111 Once the Secret Service has formulated its new standards for collection of information, it should enter into written agreements with each Federal agency
LJ050-0112 and the leading State and local agencies that might be a source of such information.
LJ050-0113 Such agreements should describe in detail the information which is sought, the manner in which it will be provided to the Secret Service,
LJ050-0114 and the respective responsibilities for any further investigation that may be required.
LJ050-0115 This is especially necessary with regard to the FBI and CIA,
LJ050-0116 which carry the major responsibility for supplying information about potential threats,
LJ050-0117 particularly those arising from organized groups, within their special jurisdiction.
LJ050-0118 Since these agencies are already obliged constantly to evaluate the activities of such groups,
LJ050-0119 they should be responsible for advising the Secret Service if information develops indicating the existence of an assassination plot
LJ050-0120 and for reporting such events as a change in leadership or dogma which indicate that the group may present a danger to the President.
LJ050-0121 Detailed formal agreements embodying these arrangements should be worked out between the Secret Service and both of these agencies.
LJ050-0122 It should be made clear that the Secret Service will in no way seek to duplicate the intelligence
LJ050-0123 and investigative capabilities of the agencies now operating in this field but will continue
LJ050-0124 to use the data developed by these agencies to carry out its special duties.
LJ050-0125 Once experience has been gained in implementing such agreements with the Federal and leading State and local agencies,
LJ050-0126 the Secret Service, through its field offices,
LJ050-0127 should negotiate similar arrangements with such other State and local law enforcement agencies as may provide meaningful assistance.
LJ050-0128 Much useful information will come to the attention of local law enforcement agencies in the regular course of their activities,
LJ050-0129 and this source should not be neglected by undue concentration on relationships with other Federal agencies.
LJ050-0130 Finally, these agreements with Federal and local authorities will be of little value
LJ050-0131 unless a system is established for the frequent formal review of activities thereunder. In this regard
LJ050-0132 the Commission notes with approval several recent measures taken and proposed by the Secret Service to improve its liaison arrangements.
LJ050-0133 In his testimony Secretary of the Treasury C. Douglas Dillon informed the Commission
LJ050-0134 that an interagency committee has been established to develop more effective criteria.
LJ050-0135 According to Secretary Dillon,
LJ050-0136 the Committee will include representatives of the President's Office of Science and Technology, Department of Defense, CIA,
LJ050-0137 FBI, and the Secret Service.
LJ050-0138 In addition, the Department of the Treasury has requested five additional agents for its Protective Research Section
LJ050-0139 to serve as liaison officers with law enforcement and intelligence agencies. On the basis of the Department's review during the past several months,
LJ050-0140 Secretary Dillon testified that the use of such liaison officers is the only effective way to insure that adequate liaison is maintained.
LJ050-0141 As a beginning step to improve liaison with local law enforcement officials, the Secret Service on August twenty-six, nineteen sixty-four,
LJ050-0142 directed its field representatives to send a form request for intelligence information to all local,
LJ050-0143 county, and State law enforcement agencies in their districts.
LJ050-0144 Each of these efforts appears sound,
LJ050-0145 and the Commission recommends that these and the other measures suggested by the Commission be pursued vigorously by Secret Service.
LJ050-0146 Automatic data processing
LJ050-0147 Unless the Secret Service is able to deal rapidly and accurately with a growing body of data,
LJ050-0148 the increased information supplied by other agencies will be wasted.
LJ050-0149 PRS must develop the capacity to classify its subjects on a more sophisticated basis than the present geographic breakdown.
LJ050-0150 Its present manual filing system is obsolete;
LJ050-0151 it makes no use of the recent developments in automatic data processing which are widely used in the business world and in other Government offices.
LJ050-0152 The Secret Service and the Department of the Treasury now recognize this critical need.
LJ050-0153 In the planning document currently under review by the Bureau of the Budget, the Department recommends that it be permitted to hire five qualified persons, quote,
LJ050-0154 to plan and develop a workable and efficient automated file and retrieval system, end quote.
LJ050-0155 Also the Department requests the sum of one hundred thousand dollars to conduct a detailed feasibility study;
LJ050-0156 this money would be used to compensate consultants, to lease standard equipment or to purchase specially designed pilot equipment.
LJ050-0157 On the basis of such a feasibility study,
LJ050-0158 the Department hopes to design a practical system which will fully meet the needs of the Protective Research Section of the Secret Service.
LJ050-0159 The Commission recommends that prompt and favorable consideration be given to this request.
LJ050-0160 The Commission further recommends that the Secret Service coordinate its planning as closely as possible with all of the Federal agencies from which it receives information.
LJ050-0161 The Secret Service should not and does not plan to develop its own intelligence gathering facilities to duplicate the existing facilities of other Federal agencies.
LJ050-0162 In planning its data processing techniques,
LJ050-0163 the Secret Service should attempt to develop a system compatible with those of the agencies from which most of its data will come. Note:
LJ050-0164 In evaluating data processing techniques of the Secret Service,
LJ050-0165 the Commission had occasion to become informed, to a limited extent, about the data processing techniques of other Federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies.
LJ050-0166 The Commission was struck by the apparent lack of effort, on an interagency basis,
LJ050-0167 to develop coordinated and mutually compatible systems, even where such coordination would not seem inconsistent
LJ050-0168 with the particular purposes of the agency involved. The Commission recognizes that this is a controversial area
LJ050-0169 and that many strongly held views are advanced in resistance to any suggestion that an effort be made to impose any degree of coordination.
LJ050-0170 This matter is obviously beyond the jurisdiction of the Commission,
LJ050-0171 but it seems to warrant further study before each agency becomes irrevocably committed to separate action.
LJ050-0172 The Commission, therefore, recommends that the President consider ordering an inquiry into the possibility
LJ050-0173 that coordination might be achieved to a greater extent than seems now to be contemplated, without interference with the primary mission of each agency involved.
LJ050-0174 Protective Research participation in advance arrangements.
LJ050-0175 Since the assassination, Secret Service procedures have been changed to require that a member of PRS accompany each advance survey team
LJ050-0176 to establish liaison with local intelligence gathering agencies and to provide for the immediate evaluation of information received from them.
LJ050-0177 This PRS agent will also be responsible for establishing an informal local liaison committee
LJ050-0178 to make certain that all protective intelligence activities are coordinated.
LJ050-0179 Based on its experience during this period, the Secret Service now recommends that additional personnel be made available to PRS
LJ050-0180 so that these arrangements can be made permanent without adversely affecting the operations of the Service's field offices.
LJ050-0181 The Commission regards this as a most useful innovation and urges that the practice be continued.
LJ050-0182 Liaison With Local Law Enforcement Agencies
LJ050-0183 Advice by the Secret Service to local police in metropolitan areas relating to the assistance expected in connection with a Presidential visit
LJ050-0184 has hitherto been handled on an informal basis.
LJ050-0185 The Service should consider preparing formal explanations of the cooperation anticipated during a Presidential visit to a city,
LJ050-0186 in formats that can be communicated to each level of local authorities.
LJ050-0187 Thus, the local chief of police could be given a master plan, prepared for the occasion, of all protective measures to be taken during the visit;
LJ050-0188 each patrolman might be given a prepared booklet of instructions explaining what is expected of him. The Secret Service has expressed concern
LJ050-0189 that written instructions might come into the hands of local newspapers, to the prejudice of the precautions described.
LJ050-0190 However, the instructions must be communicated to the local police in any event and can be leaked to the press whether or not they are in writing.
LJ050-0191 More importantly, the lack of carefully prepared and carefully transmitted instructions for typical visits to cities
LJ050-0192 can lead to lapses in protection, such as the confusion in Dallas about whether members of the public were permitted on overpasses.
LJ050-0193 Such instructions will not fit all circumstances, of course,
LJ050-0194 and should not be relied upon to the detriment of the imaginative application of judgment in special cases.
LJ050-0195 Inspection of Buildings
LJ050-0196 Since the assassination of President Kennedy, the Secret Service has been experimenting with new techniques in the inspection of buildings along a motorcade route.
LJ050-0197 According to Secretary Dillon,
LJ050-0198 the studies indicate that there is some utility in attempting to designate certain buildings as involving a higher risk than others.
LJ050-0199 The Commission strongly encourages these efforts to improve protection along a motorcade route.
LJ050-0200 The Secret Service should utilize the personnel of other Federal law enforcement offices
LJ050-0201 in the locality to assure adequate manpower for this task, as it is now doing.
LJ050-0202 Lack of adequate resources is an unacceptable excuse for failing to improve advance precautions
LJ050-0203 in this crucial area of Presidential protection.
LJ050-0204 Secret Service Personnel and Facilities
LJ050-0205 Testimony and other evidence before the Commission
LJ050-0206 suggest that the Secret Service is trying to accomplish its job with too few people and without adequate modern equipment.
LJ050-0207 Although Chief Rowley does not complain about the pay scale for Secret Service agents,
LJ050-0208 salaries are below those of the FBI and leading municipal police forces.
LJ050-0209 The assistant to the Director of the FBI testified that
LJ050-0210 the caseload of each FBI agent averaged twenty to twenty-five, and he felt that this was high.
LJ050-0211 Chief Rowley testified that the present workload of each Secret Service agent averages one hundred ten point one cases.
LJ050-0212 While these statistics relate to the activities of Secret Service agents stationed in field offices and not the White House detail,
LJ050-0213 field agents supplement those on the detail, particularly when the President is traveling.
LJ050-0214 Although the Commission does not know whether the cases involved are entirely comparable,
LJ050-0215 these figures suggest that the agents of the Secret Service are substantially overworked.
LJ050-0216 In its budget request for the fiscal year beginning July one, nineteen sixty-four,
LJ050-0217 the Secret Service sought funds for twenty-five new positions, primarily in field offices. This increase has been approved by the Congress.
LJ050-0218 Chief Rowley explained that this would not provide enough additional manpower to take all the measures which he considers required.
LJ050-0219 However, the nineteen sixty-four to sixty-five budget request was submitted in November nineteen sixty-three
LJ050-0220 and requests for additional personnel were not made because of the studies then being conducted.
LJ050-0221 The Secret Service has now presented its recommendations to the Bureau of the Budget. The plan proposed by the Service
LJ050-0222 would take approximately twenty months to implement and require expenditures of approximately three million dollars during that period.
LJ050-0223 The plan provides for an additional two hundred five agents for the Secret Service. Seventeen of this number are proposed for the Protective Research Section;
LJ050-0224 one hundred forty-five are proposed for the field offices to handle the increased volume of security investigations
LJ050-0225 and be available to protect the President or Vice President when they travel;
LJ050-0226 eighteen agents are proposed for a rotating pool which will go through an intensive training cycle and also be available to supplement the White House detail
LJ050-0227 in case of unexpected need; and twenty-five additional agents are recommended to provide the Vice President full protection.
LJ050-0228 The Commission urges that the Bureau of the Budget review these recommendations with the Secret Service and authorize a request for the necessary supplemental appropriation,
LJ050-0229 as soon as it can be justified. The Congress has often stressed that it will support any reasonable request for funds for the protection of the President.
LJ050-0230 Manpower and Technical Assistance From Other Agencies
LJ050-0231 Before the assassination the Secret Service infrequently requested other Federal law enforcement agencies to provide personnel
LJ050-0232 to assist in its protection functions.
LJ050-0233 Since the assassination, the Service has experimented with the use of agents borrowed for short periods from such agencies.
LJ050-0234 It has used other Treasury law enforcement agents on special experiments in building and route surveys in places to which the President frequently travels.
LJ050-0235 It has also used other Federal law enforcement agents during Presidential visits to cities in which such agents are stationed.
LJ050-0236 Thus, in the four months following the assassination,
LJ050-0237 the FBI, on sixteen separate occasions, supplied a total of one hundred thirty-nine agents to assist in protection work during a Presidential visit,
LJ050-0238 which represents a departure from its prior practice.
LJ050-0239 From February eleven through June thirty, nineteen sixty-four,
LJ050-0240 the Service had the advantage of nine thousand, five hundred hours of work by other enforcement agencies.
LJ050-0241 The FBI has indicated that it is willing to continue to make such assistance available,
LJ050-0242 even though it agrees with the Secret Service that it is preferable for the Service to have enough agents to handle all protective demands.
LJ050-0243 The Commission endorses these efforts to supplement the Service's own personnel by obtaining, for short periods of time,
LJ050-0244 the assistance of trained Federal law enforcement officers.
LJ050-0245 In view of the ever-increasing mobility of American Presidents, it seems unlikely that the Service could or should increase its own staff to a size
LJ050-0246 which would permit it to provide adequate protective manpower for all situations.
LJ050-0247 The Commission recommends that the agencies involved determine how much periodic assistance they can provide, and that each such agency
LJ050-0248 and the Secret Service enter into a formal agreement defining such arrangements.
LJ050-0249 It may eventually be desirable to codify the practice in an Executive order.
LJ050-0250 The Secret Service will be better able to plan its own long-range personnel requirements if it knows with reasonable certainty
LJ050-0251 the amount of assistance that it can expect from other agencies.
LJ050-0252 The occasional use of personnel from other Federal agencies to assist in protecting the President has a further advantage. It symbolizes the reality
LJ050-0253 that the job of protecting the President has not been and cannot be exclusively the responsibility of the Secret Service.
LJ050-0254 The Secret Service in the past has sometimes guarded its right to be acknowledged as the sole protector of the Chief Executive.
LJ050-0255 This no longer appears to be the case.
LJ050-0256 Protecting the President is a difficult and complex task which requires full use of the best resources of many parts of our Government.
LJ050-0257 Recognition that the responsibility must be shared increases the likelihood that it will be met.
LJ050-0258 Much of the Secret Service work requires the development and use of highly sophisticated equipment,
LJ050-0259 some of which must be specially designed to fit unique requirements. Even before the assassination, and to a far greater extent thereafter,
LJ050-0260 the Secret Service has been receiving full cooperation in scientific research and technological development
LJ050-0261 from many Government agencies including the Department of Defense and the President's Office of Science and Technology.
LJ050-0262 Even if the manpower and technological resources of the Secret Service are adequately augmented,
LJ050-0263 it will continue to rely in many respects upon the greater resources of the Office of Science and Technology and other agencies.
LJ050-0264 The Commission recommends that the present arrangements
LJ050-0265 with the Office of Science and Technology and the other Federal agencies that have been so helpful to the Secret Service be placed on a permanent and formal basis.
LJ050-0266 The exchange of letters dated August thirty-one, nineteen sixty-four,
LJ050-0267 between Secretary Dillon and Donald F. Hornig, Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, is a useful effort in the right direction.
LJ050-0268 The Service should negotiate a memorandum of understanding with each agency that has been assisting it and from which it can expect to need help in the future.
LJ050-0269 The essential terms of such memoranda might well be embodied in an Executive order.
LJ050-0270 This Commission can recommend no procedures for the future protection of our Presidents which will guarantee security.
LJ050-0271 The demands on the President in the execution of His responsibilities in today's world are so varied and complex
LJ050-0272 and the traditions of the office in a democracy such as ours are so deep-seated as to preclude absolute security.
LJ050-0273 The Commission has, however, from its examination of the facts of President Kennedy's assassination
LJ050-0274 made certain recommendations which it believes would, if adopted,
LJ050-0275 materially improve upon the procedures in effect at the time of President Kennedy's assassination and result in a substantial lessening of the danger.
LJ050-0276 As has been pointed out, the Commission has not resolved all the proposals which could be made. The Commission nevertheless is confident that,
LJ050-0277 with the active cooperation of the responsible agencies and with the understanding of the people of the United States in their demands upon their President,
LJ050-0278 the recommendations we have here suggested would greatly advance the security of the office without any impairment of our fundamental liberties.
